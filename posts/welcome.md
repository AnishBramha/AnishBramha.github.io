### What this is for

Hey there! Thanks for visiting my website! In this section of my website, I'll be posting stuff which I find interesting from various internet, from various sources: the internet (predominantly) and books (academic and non-academic). This will act as a sort of 'compilation' of my doomscrolling 'activies'. I expect these posts to be short and simple, and not as detailed as my blog.

### Where did I get this idea from?

I'll have to admit that this idea is not entirely mine. I follow a Twitch streamer and YouTuber called 'Tsoding' ([great channel by the way - check him out here!](https://www.youtube.com/@TsodingDaily)). His way of storing ideas and cool stuff he finds is in a REFERENCES.md file, during his streams. That got me into thinking if I could make a repository myself where I could dump my ideas – and this is that.
