### What's this paper?

This is a paper authored by Dr. Abdulazziz Ghuloum at Indiana University, with the aim of demystifying compilers. Compilers are usually presented as these convoluted pieces of magic code which somehow work like very annoying translators. (It also doesn't help that the cover of the famous 'Compilers: Principles, Techniques & Tools' is a fire-breathing dragon being slain by a knight. 

Personally, I felt that this paper was well-written with lucid language and step-by-step instructions on how to get started with building a compiler, shown specifically for a subset of the Scheme dialect of Lisp, to convert it into x86-64 Assembly. Topics requiring more background are briefly introduced.
