### Check it out

Really cool website for language lovers. Check it out [here](https://www.omniglot.com).


### How I (might've) stumbled upon it

I don't really remember. I've been dabbling with languages and lingusitics for as long as I can remember. One eventually encounters the deep rabbit-hole of conlanging, and so did I. It was orthography that got me into conlanging. Back then, I was obsessed with the Devanagari script and its ligature system (yeah, I thought ligatures were cool and I still do). I'd fill heaps of pages with the most cursed letter combinations to produce (I daresay beautiful) ligatures. It must have been during one of those sprees that I must've stumbled across this website. It contains possibly every single script known to man, and some conscripts too.

*Yes, I have a language and a script of my own.*

*Doesn't hit the same as 'I use Arch, btw' :(*
