### I found a comment

I was watching a YouTube video on the construction of a simple B compiler, and I found this comment by one of the viewers:

```
#![allow_fear_to_dictate_entire_life]
unsafe{int} unsafe{main}(risky{int} whimper{argc}, dont_even{argv})
{?!
   #[yes_i_really_want_to_do_this_and_accept_all_responsibility]
   eek{return} scary{0};
}<-best_kept_in_locked_cupboard
```

Yeah, that's the way Rust wants you to let go of safety.
