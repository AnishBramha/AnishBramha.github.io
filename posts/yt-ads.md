YouTube ads have gotten extremely annoying.


### Wait... Why can't Brave or uBlock do the trick?


These are usually desktop solutions, but for Android, it's browser-only for these extensions, since you can't get rid of the ads in the mobile app; or **can** you? :)

<span style="color:red">Do the following at your own risk!</span>


### Do this for the mobile app

- Get the Revanced Manager from their official [site](https://revanced.app/download).
- Check the YouTube version number in their **Patches** and get it from [APK Mirror](https://www.apkmirror.com). Do not install it yet.
- Get the Revanced GMScore [here](https://gmscore.app/).
- Turn off **Device Registration** and enable **Strip device name for authentication**.
- Open Revanced and select the YouTube APK and patch.


There you go! Enjoy some more features while you're at it.
