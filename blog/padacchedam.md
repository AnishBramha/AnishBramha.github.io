## Padacchēdam – Nuance across *Saŋgatis*

The Sanskrit word *Padacchēdam* means 'splitting of words'.

### Introduction

<div style="text-align: center;">

మమత బంధనయుత నరస్తుతి సుఖమా?

సుమతి త్యాగరాజ నుతుని కీర్తన సుఖమా?

నిధిచాల సుఖమా రాముని సన్నిధి సేవ సుఖమా?

నిజముగ బల్కు మనసా!

</div>


**_Pronunciation_**: mamata bandhanayuta narastuti sukhamā? sumati tyāgarāja nutuni kīrtana sukhamā? nidhi cāla sukhamā? rāmuni sannidhi sēva sannidhi sukhamā? nijamuga balku manasā!

**_Translation_**: What is better? To be tied to self-aggrandising praise of oneself or of others? Or is it to sing the praise of the one extolled by Tyāgarāja? Is wealth alone sufficient? Or is it the service to the abode of Rāma? Speak truthfully, O mind!


This is a very famous *kṛti* of Tyāgarāja: *Nidhi Cāla Sukhamā*, composed in the *rāgam Mēcakaḷyāṇi*.


Why did I bring this up? Take a close look at the *pallavi*. When one usually sings the *saŋgatis* for this composition, the partial phrase *rāmuni* is usually carried along from one *saŋgati* to the next. It produces the phrase '*rāmuni san...nidhi cāla sukhamā*', which has the meaning 'is Rāma's abode enough?', which does not exist in the *sāhityam* (lyrics) in the first place. That is a clever way of stringing together parts of different phrases and creating more nuance. This is commonly employed by singers in many compositions as part of improvisation, most notably by [MD Ramanathan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._D._Ramanathan).



### Other instances

- _**Yē Pāpamu Jēsitira?** (Aṭhāṇa)_ (Tyāgarāja)

<div style="text-align: center;">

ఏ పాపముఁ జేసితిర రామ

నీకేపాటైన దయ రాదు నేఁ 

</div>


**_Pronunciation_**: yē pāpamu jēsitira rāma? nīkē pāṭaina daya rādu nẽ?

**_Meaning_**: Which sin did I commit? No matter what, won't you have any mercy?

The last particle is nasalised in Telugu, and it is the first person singular. When this nasal is attached to the first word in another *saŋgati*, it sounds like '_nēnē pāpamu_', which means 'which sin', removing the specificity that the first line of the *pallavi* provided (going from *which* to *what*, almost indicating a change of mood, from knowing that one has committed a sin and seeking it out, to enquiring as if one does not know whether one has committed any sin. Again, added nuance.


- _**Endarō Mahānubhāvulu** (Śrīrāgam)_ (Tyāgarāja)

This is probably one of the best examples to illustrate this point, as the author actively makes use of this property to create a continuous, unbroken string of words with meaning. Except one, every other *caraṇam* ends with the Telugu word *vāŕu*, which is suffix meaning 'those who'. When attached to the conditional verb form and after undergoing *sandhi*, it produces a meaning 'those who \<verb-action\>'. Take a look at one *caraṇam*:

<div style="text-align: center;">

... బ్రహ్మానందమనుభవించు వాఱెందరో

మహానుభావులు అందరికీ వందనములు

</div>


**_Pronunciation_**: ... brahmānandamanubhaviñcu vāŕendarō mahānubhāvulu andariki vandanamulu

**_Meaning_**: ... those who experience joy (rest of the stanza is needed for context) are many, and they are great people!


There are more instances of this happening in many other Tyāgarāja *kṛtis*, such as:

- *Kṣīrasāgaraśayana (Dēvagāndhāri)*
- *Evari Māṭa (Harikāmbhōji)*
- *Śāntamu Lēka (Sāma)*
