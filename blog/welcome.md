## Welcome to the Blog!


### What's up with the glottal stop?

As you've probably already guessed (based on my homepage), I'm a lingusitics buff with a knack for phonetics and orthography. One of my favourite sounds is the glottal stop. In Arabic, you'd find this letter **ع** (/ʕn/), which is a glottal stop. This sound is produced at the far back of your throat, something like the 'pause' in 'uh-oh'.

Why the sound, you ask? Well, I used to write a blog in Wordpress a while ago, until, due to unfortunate circumstances, I lost access to it. That blog was named the same, because back then, I was more interested in linguistics than I am now. This blog is not for linguistics alone, but I decided that carrying the name forward seemed fun.


### Why this blog?

One might ask why I'd go to such lengths to create a separate blogging platform all for myself, with little to no views. I've been on Wordpress. I've been on Medium. I get where this question is coming from. Well, it's for a few reasons. One is simply the cool factor of having your own website (although I did not make the entire thing myself). I believe that having your own website is a great way to showcase yourself on the internet. Your own custom themes, your own custom styling and elements; you get the idea. This ties well in to another reason for having this separate entity: freedom, in more ways than one. One can only tinker so much with a Wordpress or Medium blog page (at least in my experience) before it becomes mangled and cumbersome, and one gets caught up in fighting the website instead of penning things down.

**A digression**: Yes, the theme you're looking at is not the result of some ancient/outdated libraries I'm using. It's built in (mostly) vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, no frills. Why didn't I use React? Well, first up, I didn't build this website myself. I've vibe-coded it for several reasons: a) Web development in general is an alien discipline to me, and spending quite some time learning JavaScript (I have peers who have experienced karmic punishment for doing so) did not seem to be a very good use of time, and b) It does not hurt to vibe-code things which are in now way connected to other people. This website is solely for me to work with, and other people can't do much except view it, so there is not much to lose if something does go wrong (you really are risking it if you entrust the fate of development to a stochasticism instead of determinism). Now again, I'm not one of those guys who holds a grudge against React, or Angular (whoops, my hot takes in the 'Special' section seem to disagree). I don't think a small endeavour (really?) like this (especially with LLMs) is so unmanageable that it warrants the use of a batteries-included framework.

**What's the deal with the theme?** I'm obsessed with tinkering around and customising GUIs. A substantial portion of my YouTube feed is dedicated to exploring Macintosh interfaces, right from the beginning to the present day (and of course, some overzealous compatriots who loathe Windows, although I must say; at the time of writing this, Windows 11 is kind of a dumpster fire). The concept of a global menu bar and a dock seems like a great way to navigate your system. The 3D bevelled designs, the shadows, the depth effects, all make for a great (to me, at least) desktop interface. As is clear by now, I'm a huge proponent of skeuomorphism. One of my first 'devices' was an iPod Touch from 2010 and I remember the iOS 6 interface quite fondly (RIP 2020). I wanted to emulate a similar experience on my website, and hence the design choice based on pre-OS X (Aqua) Macintoshes. It looks ancient enough that I did think about browsers flagging my website for phishing.


Okay, back to 'freedom' (mark set - he he). The other part is censorship, although it is not really a concern to me right now. I just like the idea of having a platform free of all these hillbilly rules of what one must, can and shouldn't do, where I can post anything.


### Before You Leave

One more thing (I really have to come up with original quotes :/ ) – As Mehdi Sadaghdar (from [Mehditation](https://youtu.be/IYK8tov_6u8?si=cxCZIjo7vcOqhSAP) put it, this is like my X where I let out all my Y (X and Y add a bit of colour to the phrase, that's all).
